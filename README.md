# PresentIt GUI
A Python GUI for my presentation generator library. 
I use it to create PowerPoint presentations without manually filling each slide with content. 
It allows you to specify a name, a subtitle, an optional background image, 
and slide names as input and produces a presentation on output. 
The text for each slide is located inside a text file with the same name as the slide. 
Optionally, you can add image files for some slides with an extension you select.
